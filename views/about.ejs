            Taking the WEB322 course has been an incredibly rewarding and insightful experience. Throughout the semester, I've gained a solid foundation in web development using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>, learning how to build dynamic and responsive web applications from the ground up.

            One of the highlights for me was integrating <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> to manage data efficiently, moving away from simple file-based storage to a robust relational database system. Implementing features like <strong>user authentication</strong> and session management gave me a real-world perspective on how secure web systems are architected.

            This journey has not only improved my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of full-stack development concepts. I'm excited to apply these new skills to future projects and continue exploring the vast ecosystem of web technologies.
